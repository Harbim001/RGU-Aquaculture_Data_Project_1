### Data Files

- `escapes.csv`: Contains records of fish escapes from cages.
- `analysis.csv`: Results of water analysis aligning with some of the escapes data.

### Tasks Performed

   - Data cleaning
   - Data transformation
   - Removing irrelevant data
   - Imputing missing values
   - Discarding irrelevant features
   - Deleting instances

2. Data Integration: Merged the individual datasets into a new dataset called `escapesPlus.csv`.

3. Additional Exploratory Data Analysis: Carried out further exploratory analysis of the merged dataset using various statistical functions and visualizations.

4. Additional Learning Task: Undertook one other learning task covered during the lab sessions that complements the work done in the previous tasks.
